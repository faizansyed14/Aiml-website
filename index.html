										<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a computing concept that enables a machine to think and solve complex problems as we humans do with our natural intelligence. AI is the next phase of the industrial revolution and has established itself firmly in our society. Almost all branches of industry have been affected by the ongoing transformation through its algorithms. Machine Learning explores the analysis and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. ML has proven valuable because it can solve problems at a speed and scale that cannot be duplicated by the human mind alone. With massive amounts of computational ability behind a single task or multiple specific tasks, machines can be trained to identify patterns in and relationships between input data and automate routine processes.</p>

												<h3>Communicate with the bots</h3>
												<p>Communicating with bots is a way to interact with computer programs using natural language. Bots are used for a variety of purposes, such as customer service, personal assistance, and entertainment. They can be accessed through various platforms, such as messaging apps, websites, and voice assistants. To communicate with a bot, you typically need to type or speak to it in a conversational manner. It's important to keep in mind that bots are not human and may not always understand complex or nuanced language. As the technology continues to improve, communicating with bots will become more seamless and helpful.</p>
