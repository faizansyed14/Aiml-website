									<h2>ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT</h2>
									<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a computing concept that enables a machine to think and solve complex problems as we humans do with our natural intelligence. AI is the next phase of the industrial revolution and has established itself firmly in our society. Almost all branches of industry have been affected by the ongoing transformation through its algorithms. Machine Learning explores the analysis and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. ML has proven valuable because it can solve problems at a speed and scale that cannot be duplicated by the human mind alone. With massive amounts of computational ability behind a single task or multiple specific tasks, machines can be trained to identify patterns in and relationships between input data and automate routine processes. The AI & ML has opened up exciting new opportunities for interdisciplinary work across many fields including computer science, mathematics, statistics, and information science from which it draws foundational knowledge and the current demand for a career in AI & ML is considerable and growing daily. The B.Tech (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) course addresses this transformation by providing you as a student with the broad and in-depth skills required to work with and develop AI. You will be trained how to obtain, process and store enormous amounts of data, which is the root of AI and development processes.</p>
